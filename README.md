# How-to-build-your-information-flow
With the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market, investors and traders need to stay informed. That's when they need to build their information flow. The return on investment can only be maximised and secured when faster and more complete information is available.

Today we are talking about how to structure our information flow. Here's how I got my information, and the characteristics of each approach.

News Website

Frist, news sites are the easiest and quickest way to get information. I go through all the news sites every morning so I can quickly find out what's going on and what projects have been funded. Two popular news sites, CoinDesk and Cointelegraph, are recommended. I recommend these two news sites because they have the fastest news updates and a wider range of news types. 

Brief

Second, many people would choose websites such as finSMEs and Chaincatcher to obtain information, because these websites are the easiest to obtain information because they will express the main content of news succinctly, which makes it more convenient for users to understand the content of news, but there are also limitations. There is a delay in the speed of updates due to the need to streamline the news.

Twitter

Third, Twitter is also the fastest way to get information. I go to Twitter every day to see what the KOLs are talking about and what the current hot trends are. But one problem with Twitter's recommendation algorithm is that if you do not check a KOL regularly, you may not see it for a while. Therefore, it is suggested to set up a "list" that lists the KOL of each plate into the subdivision plate.

These lists have been of great service to me in obtaining information, which has been well directed. A lot of the alpha I get comes from looking at the list. The KOLs in the list also retweet the tweets of different KOLs, so it is easy to form a circle of quality information channels, but you have to filter the list of bloggers.

CZ is a KOL that I pay particular attention to. His Twitter feed is like an information aggregator. He would find hot spots in the market, sort them out and send them to everyone. The quality of his original content is also extremely strong. I especially love the combination of messages he does.

Community

Finally, there is the neighborhood, where the news is a bit muddled and may not be first-hand. But there are a handful of paying communities that offer great content. So if you are trying to improve your access to information by joining a large community, I say stop thinking about it.

Conclusion

In the age of huge data, we need to face tens of thousands of messages a day. I found it difficult when I first set up the information flow because the information was scattered and I needed to spend a lot of time searching until I found the news API-pro.blockcc. Pro.blockcc provides 200+ crypto news data sources covering news sites, briefs, tweets and communities.  With pro.blockcc, users can choose to search by time range, language, news source, or text filter to filter out the information they need, and up to 2,000 news data can be retrieved at a time.
The response speed of the API is swift, the information accuracy is great, and the processing cost is moderate, which saves me a lot of time.
